# Railway Mobile App

### Running The Project

Make sure your environment is set up to run the iOS Simulator. 

`yarn install`

`yarn ios` 

The project has not been tested against android, my current dev machine is very old and it will suffer quite a bit if I had both simulators (and the time required to swap between them also hurts). 


### Currently: 

A Mobile app that lets you deploy, delete, redeploy, and rollback your services on railway. It can be any user, there's a special screen for setting API Tokens, Project Id, and Env Id. The layout is inspired from the railway web product, and so are some of the deployment flows.

I genuinely believe this would be a fun MVP to test and get feedback for.
